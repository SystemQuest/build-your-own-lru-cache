# Build Your Own LRU Cache

This is a starting point for {{language_name}} solutions to the
**"Build Your Own LRU Cache"** challenge.

An LRU (Least Recently Used) cache is a data structure that stores a limited number of items and removes the least recently used item when the cache is full.

## Quick Start

The entry point for your LRU Cache implementation is in `{{user_editable_file}}`.

### Run locally

```sh
# Run your program
./your_program.sh
```

### Test commands

```sh
INIT 10       # Initialize cache with capacity 10
PUT k1 v1     # Store key-value pair
GET k1        # Retrieve value by key
SIZE          # Get current cache size
```

## Challenge Stages

- **Stage 1**: Basic cache operations (INIT, PUT, GET)
- **Stage 2**: FIFO eviction
- **Stage 3**: LRU eviction
- **Stage 4**: O(1) operations
- **Stage 5**: Thread safety
